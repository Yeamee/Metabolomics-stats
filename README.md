Medical treatments for breast cancer include adjuvant chemotherapy which is usually administered after surgery and neoadjuvant therapy usually administered prior to surgery with the aim of reducing the size of the tumour in order to make it operable. Both forms of chemotherapy give comparable outcomes.
The different cells, tissues, and organs of the body are made up of numerous small molecules called metabolites. Metabolomics refers to the comprehensive analysis of the metabolites in a biological sample. Since the levels of metabolites can change due to diseases or in response to treatment, metabolomics can play an important role in monitoring treatment response.    
The dataset used in our study comprises information of 447 breast cancer patients with corresponding individual metabolites of 138.  [see supplementary file MTBLS92.xlsx] 
The aims of this study were to assess and analyse: 
•	how the metabolite levels of premenopausal patients differed from those of postmenopausal patients.  
•	what effect the stages of breast cancer has on chemotherapy response.  
•	whether or not the body mass index of patients has any association with either their menopausal status or their response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
It was observed that a lot of the metabolites differed based on their classes as well as their menopausal status. The node cancer stages has an association with breast cancer. It was also observed that the body mass index of patients did not influence the comparison of the metabolites in the different classes.
